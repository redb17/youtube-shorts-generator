5 facts about our solar system
Our solar system consists of eight planets that orbit around the sun. These planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

The sun is at the center of the solar system and makes up more than 99% of its total mass. It is a massive, hot ball of gas and is responsible for providing the light and energy that sustains life on Earth.

The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, contains millions of small rocks and larger objects that orbit around the sun. Some asteroids are known to be composed of valuable metals, which has led to interest in mining them in the future.

Our solar system also contains comets, which are icy objects that originate from the outer reaches of the solar system. Comets have highly elliptical orbits and can take many years to complete a single orbit around the sun.

The largest planet in the solar system is Jupiter, which is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Its size and strong gravity make it a key player in the dynamics of the entire solar system, influencing the orbits of other planets and asteroids.
